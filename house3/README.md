# house 3

In this model the houses have a window in the south roof.

The standard built-in roof windows, which are installed at the same angle as the roof, are problematic. The main issues are:
- poor isolation (TODO: explain why)
- condensation on the inside leading to mold

The roof windows should always be installed at 90 deg, just like regular window.
