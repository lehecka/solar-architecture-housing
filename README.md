# Solar architecture
This repo contains links a files with information about the next generation of passive houses, so called solar houses. The most progressive country which leads in this effort is Germany. That's why most of the links will be pointing to the German websites.

The solar houses are passive houses to begin with. On top of the passive standard there are features which maximize the use of solar energy for heating. The dominant feature of the solar houses is asymetrical roof. The south part of the roof and sometimes walls are covered with photovoltaic and photothermal solar panels. The south roof is typically at the 60 deg elevation to maximize the efficiency of the solar panels in the time of the year when the sun is low under the horizon - fall thru spring. The north part of the roof is typically flat or with minor elevation.

A typical solar house can be found here: [ENERGETIKhaus100 country](http://www.fasa-ag.de/cms/upload/images_header/e100/e100_country.jpg)

There are also more progressive, avantgarde, houses which a techically more advanced: [virtual tracker house](http://www.suedwestsolar.de/19.0.html)
Unfortunatelly, sometimes, the visual design of such houses is not considered strongly and the techical features totally dominate the overall look.

Here are the basic principles for a solar house:

In this repo there are other files with sketches and individual studies of different parts of the house.
The sketches are created in free version of [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/), a 3D modelling sw.
